                    <p>In a football era of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, the race for the Ballon d’Or prize has become a bigger question of who will be third place? In the last 13 years, only one player has won the award over Messi or Ronaldo, and that was Luka Modrić in 2018. The award is much less competitive than it’s ever been, thanks to Messi and Ronaldo, but also more important and followed. </p>

                    <p>For starters, some explanation on the award itself is necessary. The Ballon d’Or – French for “golden ball” – prize started in 1956 from the French publication called <a href="https://www.francefootball.fr/" target="blank_"> France Football </a>, and was originally known as the European Football of the Year award. It’s the longest-standing and most prestigious honor for a player on the pitch. </p>

                    <h3> History of the prize </h3>
                        
                        <p>In 1995, FIFA began the World Player of the Year award, which opened up players from outside of Europe to be eligible for recognition. However, in 2010, the two awards combined by FIFA to create essentially the most renowned football award in the world, the FIFA Ballon d’Or. Six years later though, FIFA decided to go back to having two separate honors: the Ballon d’Or by France Football and FIFA’s The Best.</p>

                        <p>The Ballon d’Or prize is voted on mostly by a panel of football journalists, arguably some of those that study the sport the best. Starting in 2016, the editorial team at France Football created an initial shortlist of 30 players to be made each year, which will then be reviewed by a jury of esteemed football journalists around the world. The jury then ranks the top-five players in order of who should receive the award. The selections are analyzed based on: individual/team performances in the year, player class, and opinion on the player’s whole career. </p>

                        <p> As of March this year, the award will be analyzed, decided, and released on the span of a European football season calendar (August to July), when in the past, it’s been through an actual calendar year. The 2022 Ballon d’Or prize is set to be announced in October. </p>

                        <p> With this year’s World Cup taking place in November in Qatar, what does that mean for this year’s prize? In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca9-tY_IKZD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="blank_"> Instagram post </a> made by France Football announcing the change, the editorial said that the World Cup will impact the 2023 Ballon d'Or. </p>

                        <p> While the World Cup won’t be in effect for this year’s winner, international tournaments hold a heavy importance in the conversation of each year’s recipient. </p>

The UEFA Champions League hosts Europe’s most elite club teams and produces the highest club trophy achievable. Modrić’s accomplishments in international tournaments that year were a major reason that out of his 163 total votes that year, 48% were for first place. </p>

                        <p> Reed Widdoes, an avid fan of the game for over a decade, follows the sport and the Ballon d’Or intently. He said it’s a bit surprising with how many forwards have won it lately, but he believes it’s because the game has evolved since the first Ballon d’Or in 1956.</p>

                        <p> “It reflects the modern game being so much more attack focused,” he said. A defender hasn’t received the award since Fabio Cannavaro from Real Madrid C.F. in 2006, and only two midfielders have won since then as well. </p>

                        <p> Widdoes said, “I think that over the past decade, the only center back that legitimately deserved a Ballon d’Or would’ve been Virgil van Dijk, and he still didn’t win it.” Van Dijk, who plays for Liverpool, was the runner up to Messi for the prize in 2019. </p>

                        <p> In a sense, it seems pretty simple. The players that score more goals, draw more attention to themselves…but that doesn’t seem to be the case if a player hasn’t already built up its own brand name. </p>

            </div>
        </div>
      
        <!-- SECTION FIVE -->
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h3>Brand recognition </h3>
                    <p>The next significant technical aspect that’s played a role in voters’ decisions in the past is name recognition. A prime example of this is Dušan Vlahović from Juventus F.C. The 22-year-old from Serbia has 27 goals to his name for the 2021-22 season, according to the Transfer Market <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.us/du-scaron-an-vlahovi%C4%87/leistungsdaten/spieler/357498" target="blank_"> statistics. </a></p>

                    <p>Widdoes says that these are Messi/Ronaldo numbers, but Vlahović won’t be in the conversation for the award because he wasn’t in the later <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/fixtures-results/#/rd/2001309-1" target="blank_"> stages of the UEFA Champions Leauge </a>, and doesn’t have any brand recognition.</p>

                    <p>“I think that you could look at individuals who have had seasons that were just monumental, but don’t get the respect they deserve because they aren’t already a well established name,” he said.</p>

                    <p> When looking at the data and nominees since 1956, a player that’s appeared in the running for the prize before (been nominated/in the shortlist) is 19 times more likely to win the prize than a player that hasn’t. </p>

                </div>

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <h3>Predicting the future of the prize</h3>
                    <p>So with three trends that show through in the data – the importance of team performance in international tournaments, a player’s position, and name recognition – it could be a bit easier to predict who will be the next Ballon d’Or victor, both for 2022 and 2023 depending on World Cup turnouts.</p>

                    <p>Widdoes narrowed down his top-three ranks on the spot, with a bit of struggle. He hopes that Messi or Ronaldo don’t win this year’s award since neither are in their best seasons. However, because of the brands they've built up and name recognition, they could still make the top three. He hesitantly chose Ronaldo at the third rank because of "Ronaldo hype.”</p>

                        <li class="list-group-item">Karim Benzema - France, Real Madrid C.F.</li>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p> For the winner, Widdoes picked Karim Benzema, a player for Real Madrid. The French player is not only a forward, but will be playing in the Champions League final against Liverpool, scored in both legs of the semi-finals against Manchester City, and has appeared in the running for the award six times since 2011. </p>

                    <p> “Everyone’s talking about Karim Benzema deserving the Ballon d’Or…even Mbappé was saying to the press that he wants a Ballon d’Or for Benzema because he’s just that good of a player,” Widdoes said. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="cover-pic">

        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">

                    <p> Benzema, at 34 years old, checks a number of boxes and factors that have played into the winner in the past, including a clear name recognition since Kylian Mbappé, another strong player in Europe, credited him for his skills and talent. </p>

                    <p>Widdoes does believe his top-three is subject to change depending on if Liverpool wins the Champions Leauge in the final taking place on the 28th of May.</p>

                    <p> Utimately though, Widdoes stated the components he believes will depict the winner: “In order to win the Ballon d’Or, you need to be incredibly technically gifted and just beyond the best season of your life…or you need to be Messi or Ronaldo.”</p>

                    <p> So in a year where the award will be announced in-between the Champions League Final and the 2022 World Cup, and a time when other players seem to be out-performing football’s two most recognized stars, this Ballon d’Or might no longer be the race for third place.</p>

                    <p> The 2022 Ballon d’Or will be announced in October 2022. </p>
